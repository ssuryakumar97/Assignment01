1. Write a blog on difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2.

The main difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2 is multiplexing.
Multiplexing stands for loading the data simultaneously.
In HTTP1.1 if client ask for the several data server will send the data one after another after receiving confirmation from the client.
While in HTTP2 if client ask for the several data server will send all data's parallely(simultaneously).Here client will recieve the data simultaneously.

2. Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in javascript.

Objects are defined as unordered collection of related data's. Obejects are represented in terms of key:value pair structure.

Object representation:
var cars={
name:"TATA Harrier"
Seater:"5"
color: "White"
}

name represents key & tata harrier represents the value for that key.
